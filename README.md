# AIZheng

This repository contains the code for the AIZheng project from the SVAI p1RCC Hackathon, which studied the PanTCGA dataset (for members of the Feltus lab at Clemson University, this data can be accessed [here](https://clemson.app.box.com/folder/49390954776).). Specifically, this project looked at the relationships between tumor type and tumor stage, for three specific kidney tumor types:

- KICH
- KIRC
- KIRP

This repository provides the `extract.py` script, which extracts the kidney data and metadata from the PanTCGA dataset into a standard GEM format which can be plugged into many other tools for data mining.
